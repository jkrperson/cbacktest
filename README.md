# Cbacktest

The project is a C++ implementation of Michael Halls Moore's python backtesting lib and is done as an independent project for quantitative development. 

Cbacktest is a backtesting application built using C. It should provide the necessary framework for simple backtesting using 1 stock and a strategy.

A better data management method is required in order to expand the project.
